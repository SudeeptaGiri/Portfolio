# Portfolio Website (Under Development)

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, currently under development. The website is designed to showcase my work, skills, and experience to potential employers and clients. Please note that this version of the website is not yet responsive and may not display correctly on all devices.

## Development Status

The website is currently under development, and there are several key points to be aware of:

- **Not Responsive**: The website is not responsive at the moment. It may not display correctly on mobile devices or smaller screens.
- **Content Placeholder**: The project descriptions and some content may be placeholder text and will be replaced with actual content.
- **Styling and Layout**: The styling and layout may be incomplete or subject to change.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (for future interactivity)

## Installation

To view the website locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Roadmap

In the future, I plan to make several improvements to this portfolio website, including:

- Implementing responsive design to ensure the website looks great on all devices.
- Adding more interactive elements to engage visitors.
- Continuously updating and improving the content.
